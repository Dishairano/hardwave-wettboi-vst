//! A short log of what the editor did, written to a file the user can send us.
//!
//! Everything the editor knows about a failed window — whether a token was
//! found, which URL it loaded, whether the WebView was created, whether the
//! interface answered — was already printed to stderr. No DAW shows stderr to
//! the person using it, so on the machines where the window stays empty none of
//! it ever reaches us, and every report costs another round of questions.
//!
//! The same lines are now appended to
//! `<data dir>/hardwave/wettboi-editor.log`, which on Windows is
//! `%APPDATA%\hardwave\wettboi-editor.log`. It holds the last few runs: the
//! file is truncated once it passes `MAX_BYTES`, so it cannot grow without
//! bound on a machine that opens the plug-in every day.
//!
//! It contains no audio, no project data and no token: the URL is logged
//! without its query string.
